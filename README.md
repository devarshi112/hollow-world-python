To run the `main.py` and invoke the `helper.py` in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Open the Project in VS Code
1. Open VS Code.
2. Use **File > Open Folder** and select the root directory of your project (`hollow-world-python` in this case).
   ```
   hollow-world-python/
   ├── service/
   │   └── helper.py
   └── main.py
   ```

---

### Step 2: Install Python Extension (If Not Installed)
1. Go to the **Extensions View** (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS).
2. Search for **Python** and install the extension by Microsoft.

---

### Step 4: Run the Code
1. Open `main.py` in VS Code.
2. In the top-right corner, click the **Run and Debug** button (green play icon).
   - Alternatively, press `F5` to start debugging or `Ctrl+F5` (Cmd+F5 on macOS) to run without debugging.
3. VS Code will execute the `main.py` file, and you should see the output (`Hello, world!`) in the **Terminal** window.

---

### Step 5: Manually Running from the Terminal
If you prefer to run the script manually:
1. Open the **Integrated Terminal** in VS Code (Ctrl+` or View > Terminal).
2. Ensure you're in the root directory (`hollow-world-python`) of your project. If not, navigate there using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/hollow-world-python
   ```
3. Run the code:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**:
   - If `from service.helper import get_greeting` raises an error, ensure:
     - The `service` folder contains an `__init__.py` file (can be empty).
     - You're running the code from the root directory (`hollow-world-python`).

2. **Python Not Found**:
   - Ensure Python is installed and added to your system PATH. Run `python --version` in the terminal to check.

3. **Set Working Directory**:
   - If your working directory isn't set correctly in VS Code, you can configure it:
     - Go to **Run and Debug** (Ctrl+Shift+D), click on `create a launch.json file`, and set the `cwd` (current working directory) to the project's root folder.

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Now your code should run smoothly in VS Code!
